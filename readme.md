# hi!
###### i didn't expect to be making a readme file but here we are.
### so welcome to the readme file, where i should tell you what this is, what you can do, etc., but am really lazy so it might not be that great.

# now, what is this?
 this is a github repo containing some random code i either made or found online.

# what can you do?
 well, you can test stuff that i put here.
### for example:
 i have made a [`/testing`](https://github.com/bornlikeariver/randomcode/tree/master/testing) directory for you to check for bugs with. of course, you aren't limited to that directory. you can check the main folders for bugs too, but the files that i have not personally checked for bugs, and you could help out by opening an issue, pointing it out. whether the issue be
 * something that makes it actually nonfunctional
 * something that makes it unnecessarily slow
 * or just something that makes it look less pretty than it could've looked.

 if you do this, i will give you an option to put your username in a markdown file called "volunteered-testers.md" (or something along those lines. maybe "credits.md" would be a better name) (you can choose your name, i will format it to be a link to your github page anyways)


## have fun. :D
